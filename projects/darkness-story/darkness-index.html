    <p> The darkness is a type of element that <span class="spooky">looms</span> throughout the night, while the moon
        shines at an area of
        the earth with the sun shining at another part, and in certain circumstances. The dark can either be a figment
        of evil or good
        necessity. People would think of darkness as a symbol of fear as there would be many demons that would appear to
        be frightening. On
        the contrary, there are certain people that tend to succumb to it in a way that can be proper or not. The proper
        notion is that
        people can get by without having to run to their bedrooms the second they turn off the lights from the other
        room or even use it
        while playing hide-and-seek. There have also been claims of a handful of people that can manupulate the dark
        energies
        through a type of magic.
        Either way, the darkness can be conquered or partnered.</p>
    <p class="example"> One possible animal that people can think of when talking about the darkness is a cat. These
        lovable
        creatures have nine lives
        and are currently owned by some humans. Cats also have night vision so they can see well in the dark and can
        adapt to any obstacle
        that the night sky throws at them. They were even considered as gods in Ancient Egypt at the time. It was no
        wonder that cats are
        special. Well, I'm not sure all of them are.</p>

    <p> Before people started making light switches for their houses and making lamp posts for steets, towns used to be
        completely dark. Forests and rural areas such as farms also get dark as they don't have the special lights that
        the big cities or
        highways that we do. As a result of total darkness, it is possible to see every star in close range to Earth
        with just the human eye.
        It would be nice to be able to see every star without having to use a telescope, despite the fact that
        telescopes makes seeing the
        star much clearer. What is going on is that all of the flashy lights in our real world -forests not included-
        are making the night sky
        darker and leads to less visibilty of the stars. That can mean that light only moves the darkness somewhere else
        so that, when the
        light fades, darkness comes in.</p>
    <p> On the subject of light moving darkness, shadows are involed with the movement of light. As mentioned before,
        the moon shines at one
        area of the earth while the sun shines on another area. Though, the earth and the moon spins and orbits around
        the sun so the areas
        being shown changes, hence the day-and-night cycle. According to the dictionary, a shadow is "a dark figure or
        image cast on the
        ground or some surface by a body of intercepting light", not relating to politics. As time progresses during the
        daytime, you would
        start to notice that the shadow of yourself or a nearby tree rotates, just like sunflowers as they tend to face
        the sun. This is
        evident that shadows moves when the light moves, or in which case, the darkness.
    </p><!--One adjective definition I found of a shadow is "without official authority"-->
    <p> The <strong>main</strong> or common reason people fear the dark is a fear of death itself; that anyone or
        anything can sneak in on the
        person and possibly kill or torure them to death. There have been stories all over the internet about monsters
        that can kill or scare
        the living soul out of them. These monsters can act from creepy relatives to uncomprehensible creatures, all
        with a different story.
        Normal or not, every story has a moral in each ending. For example, there were ghosts in what may seem an lone
        house on the hills
        to most that only two people could see. The person that wrote the story may have decided to help out the ghost
        neighbors with his
        mother, making it a relatively good ending in a way that may needs to be delved further.</p>
    <p id="end"> Overall, most of our lives cannot function without the dark. Most plants, of course, do need sunlight
        along with the water
        and carbon dioxide to be able to grow and perform photosynthesis. Though, plants do rest or stop under the
        moonlit sky, otherwise all
        of the carbon dioxide would be taken while we sleep, changing the pH of our blood, and not be able to create
        things such as dry ice
        and prevent fire from continuosly burning. There are plants that grow under the moonlit sky such as chcolate
        daisies and Queen of the
        Night flowers. Consecutively, while we humans sleep (if you haven't started going to work or woken up in the
        middle of the night to
        grab a snack), animals such as bats tend to be active in the darkness. Thus, there is a balance between light
        and dark if you have
        not seen it already.</p>
